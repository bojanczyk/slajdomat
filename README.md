# slajdomat
This is a program for making zooming slides in Figma.

To see how the software works, and how to install it without building it yourself, see the
[User guide](doc/user-guide.md).



### How to compile

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). 
To compile and build, do:

	npm install
	npm run make

 Once you have successfully built it, then the app will be in the out directory, and the figma plugin will be in the figma-plugin.
