# slajdomat
This is a program for making zooming slides in Figma.

You can compile yourself (see below), or  install the latest release from [here](https://github.com/bojanczyk/slajdomat/releases/latest). To see how the software works, see the
[User guide](docs/README.md).

### How to compile

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). 
To compile and build, do:

	npm install
	npm run make

Once you have successfully built it, then the app will be in the out directory, and the figma plugin will be in the figma-plugin.
