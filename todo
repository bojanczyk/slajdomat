- keep the instructions available in the viewer app, even when the presentation folder has already been selected
- disable various buttons in the viewer app when they are not needed, for example when the presentation folder has not been selected
- maybe sound can be handled on the app side, e.g. using https://recordrtc.org , so that ffmpeg can be avoided
