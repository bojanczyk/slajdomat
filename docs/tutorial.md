## Tutorial

We begin in Figma by creating some content.

### Create content in Figma
In Figma, create a new design file (which will be a presentation) using this button:

<img src="images/new-design-file.png" alt="Plugin when started" width="20%">


You will get an empty project. Now open the Slajdomat plugin (from the plugins menu). When opened in an empty design file, it should look like this: 

<img src="images/plugin-start.png" alt="Plugin when started" width="50%">

Click the slide size that you want. (Don't stress too much about the proportions, if the projector has the wrong proportions, your slides will still display.) This will create your first slide, and your screen will look like this:

<img src="images/after-creating-slide.png" alt="After creating slide" width="100%">

Now draw some pictures in Figma. In this example, I created two pieces of text. 

<img src="images/two-pieces-of-text.png" alt="Drew two pieces of text" width="100%">

Select the two pictures (or any number of pictures), and then click on the eye <img src="images/eye.png" alt="eye icon" width="16px"> icon in the plugin. This will create two events in your slide, which show the two pieces of text. 

<img src="images/plugin-with-two-pieces-of-text.png" alt="Plugin with two pieces of text" width="50%">


You can reorder the two events. When creating the events, the plugin tries to guess the correct order (top-to-bottom, or left-to-right). 

### Exporting

Now we enter the second phase, where the slides are compiled. Make sure that your Slajdomat app is running.
