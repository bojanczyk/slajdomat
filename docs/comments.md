Slajdomat supports comments on slides. These are stored in an sql database. To configure comments, you need to have access to some sql database. This means that you will have four things: a server name for the database, a username in it, a password, and a database name inside that database. 

Use the script 

```bash
<?php
// these are only examples
$servername = "database.mimuw.edu.pl";
$username = "bojanczyk";
$password = "a password";
$dbname = "bojan";
```
dd
